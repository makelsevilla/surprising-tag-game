# Surprising Tag Game

## About

Final project output for my subject Elective 4 (Python). It is a Two-Player Tag game with a twist. There are hidden teleportation objects scattered randomly in the game screen that when a player collides with it, player will be randomly teleported anywhere in the game screen. Other feature is the Effect Object which are colored red or blue that will slow down or speed up the player, the catch is that the player who will receive the Effect is also random.

## How to play

Open a terminal in the project root directory.  
Run `python ./main.py` or `python3 ./main.py`.
Enter player 1 and player 2 name in the terminal.  
Enter the total round for the game.  
Go back to the game screen.

## Game Mechanics

Player 1 controls are (W,A,S,D) keys.  
Player 2 controls are the arrow keys.  
The current "IT" must tag the other player within the time limit.  
The game will end after the total rounds is reached.
